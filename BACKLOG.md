# Backlog

A running list of ideas and not-yet-started work for Little Grip. Drop half-formed
ideas here as they come up; we knock them out in focused batches rather than one-at-a-time
(see the "Working efficiently" note in `CLAUDE.md`). Keep entries short — one line of intent,
plus a note on scope/surface if it matters.

Status key: `[ ]` open · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done (move to the bottom or delete)

## Open

- [ ] **Port the recent demo-first work to the mobile app.** These all shipped and are verified in
  the web demo but are not yet in the Expo app (mobile needs a device/emulator to drive + verify):
  - The two new games — **Cutting Practice** (`cut-along`) and **Number Path Hop** (`number-hop`)
    — are demo-only; add them to `apps/mobile/.../games/registry.ts` + `GamePlayer`/new players.
  - **Feed the Animal** — layout tweaks (big centre animal + right food column), seamless feeding,
    and the Again/Back completion card (no Home) — demo has them; mobile `FeedAnimalGame` doesn't.
  - **Draw panel redesign** (Magic drawer) — demo `renderDrawing` done; port to mobile `DrawingBoard`.
  - **Colour by Numbers number-locked flow** — core data + demo done; mobile has no line-art
    colouring pipeline at all yet (line-art scenes are filtered from the mobile picker).
  - **Tracing controls** (colour picker / CAPS / undo-trash / name-finish) — still demo-only.
  - **Stylus behaviour on-device** — pen-first fixes shipped (see Done); verify with the real stylus.

- [ ] **"What comes next?" — more pages with the owner's uploaded art, split by age.** Today there
  is a single page (`preschool-sequence`, sun/moon SVG icons, plain A-B alternation). Build more
  pages from art already in `assets/images/` (feed foods: strawberry / cupcake / watermelon /
  ice-cream / grass / plant1 / plant2; plus hop-stone, cut-cake, cut-car, mascot):
  - **Easy pages (ageBands `['3-5']`)**: simple **AB** patterns, short sequence (~4 shown + "?"),
    2-3 answer choices. Suggested pages: fruit snack (strawberry/watermelon), sweet treats
    (cupcake/ice-cream), kangaroo food (grass/plant1).
  - **Difficult pages (ageBands `['5-7']`)**: harder pattern types — **ABC**, **AAB**, **AABB** —
    longer sequence (~6 shown), 3 answer choices. Suggested pages: picnic mix
    (strawberry/cupcake/watermelon ABC), garden (plant1/plant2/grass AAB or AABB), on-the-go
    (cut-car/hop-stone/mascot ABC).
  - **Engine change needed**: `sequenceGame` in `demo-shell.html` only alternates two images —
    add a `pattern` param to the schema/params (e.g. `'AB' | 'ABC' | 'AAB' | 'AABB'`) and have
    the renderer build the shown sequence + correct answer from it, rounds cycling which image
    plays which role. Confirm `itemHtml()` resolves raster keys (feed-* PNGs), not just SVG names.
  - Per-page tiles follow the per-game icon rule (each page can show its own first image).
  - Demo-first; mobile port folds into the existing port item above.

- [ ] **Verify the mobile app is adaptive across device sizes.** The web demo was audited and
  fixed for 320-1366px; the Expo app's layouts haven't been checked on small phones vs. large
  tablets — best done on a device/emulator.

- ~~**Build a Face** — drag eyes/nose/mouth onto a blank head.~~ **Parked** at owner's request
  (July 2026) — revisit later. No art needed for now.

### Draw panel — two small decisions still open (defaults shipped)
(1) the **eraser** is kept (rubs out part; "Start over" wipes all) — say if you'd rather drop it;
(2) the **magic set** is rainbow/glitter/glow/star + heart stamps — stamps are emoji for now,
swap in cute art whenever ready.

## Done

- [x] **Feed the Animal — seamless feeding + Again/Back completion** — drops are never bounced by
  the chomp animation (rapid feeds restart the chomp cleanly), the mouth drop-zone is 30% more
  generous, missed foods spring home smoothly instead of teleporting, and finishing shows only
  **"🍽️ Feed again" / "⬅️ Back (one screen)"** — no Home option. (Demo; mobile in port item.)
- [x] **Cutting Practice — split reworked (Option A)** — the two halves now **tip and slide
  outward** (rotate + drift, smoothstep-eased) like pieces flopping open, instead of the broken
  straight up/down slide; the **cut opens progressively** (a widening sliver of white paper behind
  the blades); drifting off the line pulses the scissors as a gentle come-back cue.
- [x] **Colour by Numbers — number-locked flow** — each page's palette is tagged to numbers
  (schema `byNumberPlan` + per-region target maps authored for bunny/car/flower/puppy). The child
  is locked to colour 1; filling every region marked 1 retires it and activates colour 2, and so
  on; finishing the last number celebrates + completes. Wrong-number and background taps are
  gently rejected; tapping the printed digit itself now hops to the region (kids do that).
  Verified end-to-end on all 4 pages headlessly.
- [x] **Stylus support (best-effort — verify on your device)** — pen-first palm rejection on every
  canvas (a palm landing first no longer blocks/breaks the stylus line; the pen takes over),
  coalesced high-frequency pen samples on drawing board / guided drawing / tracing / cutting /
  colouring brush (continuous lines), pointercancel no longer eats in-flight strokes, and dragged
  game items recover from cancelled touches.
- [x] **Per-game tile icons (Option A)** — the shared 🐣 chick is gone: Feed shows the real
  mascot/kangaroo art, Cutting shows the scissors art, Hop shows the lily-pad art, and every other
  game has its own emoji (🫧 🐶 🧺 🃏 🔢 🔎 🔤 ➡️ 🧱 👥 ✨ 🔷). Demo (art + emoji) & mobile (emoji).
- [x] **Tracing for the 2-3 band (Shapes only)** — 2-3 home now has the Tracing door; it opens
  straight to Shapes (no chooser, no back-to-chooser button); Letters/Numbers/My Name stay 3-5+.
  Core layout + tests + both pickers (demo & mobile).
- [x] **Draw panel redesign (Magic drawer, Layout 2)** — demo done + verified (see earlier entry).
- [x] **Cutting Practice / Number Path Hop games** — built with owner art (demo).
- [x] **Feed the Animal** (2 characters, real art) · **Top bar layout** (adaptive) · **Blank
  Canvas direct** · **Colour split two sections** · **3 colour pages removed** · **Big Kid Games
  retired** · **Responsive audit fixes** — all shipped earlier (July 2026).
